* field
** default_placement_tip should be a class property
** closed should not have a setter, from_json_obj() can assign it directly
** type, name in some Field subclasses could be class params
** maybe get rid of type getter? (it should be synonymous with its class)
* write tests for every field type
** include test_from_json_obj
** include _default_placement_tip
** include type getter
** include name getter
** include closed
** closed should not be none after using from_json_obj()
** abstract a test for a simple field
* turn back placements into a property
* add field_handler
* from_json should trigger read_only
* write a getter/setter decorator
* write a signatory.py
** fields
** _from_json()
** getters/setters
* write a documentation from code and get someone from scrive to review it
* write a document.py
* update __init__.py
* add tests
* write a documentation
* add setup.py
* port to other python versions
* write utility functions
** field
*** set_single_placement
*** add_placement
* polish type_value_unifier
